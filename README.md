# Week-1-
I am working on what Machine Learning Algorithms we can use for Forecasting the Crypto Coins we are using in this project . As the first leg of the project we had to decide on what algorithms would work on the forecasting in real time and I decided that the Machine Learning algorithms we would like to use would be three . Upon working on the project we will decide which algorithm will work better in real time and has the least mean square error as that is the criterion we are basing the forecasting on along with the accuracy . So the algorithms are Random Forest in this particular case it would be a regression random forest because we need to forecast the next return . The second one would be SVM. So we know that the SVM ‘s can be used as both classifiers and Regressors but here we are using it as a regression algorithm.Last but not the least we would use LSTM.We will train LSTM with a data that will be suitable to us and we can find sustainable methods for prediction . Let’s go into the three algorithms in detail.
What I worked on this week was using LInear Regression model on the financial data but upon using it on the time series I realised that this model started over-fiitng and cause a huge RMSE.

I am explained it in the report above
